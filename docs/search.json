Ocean and Society, 2, Article 8924. https://doi.org/10.17645/oas.8924\n\n\nAbstract\nIn recent years, ocean governance has called for strategic action and science‐informed policy to work towards the sustainable development of the ocean, most notably as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030). This common framework identifies the integration of scientific knowledge in governance as a key process to deliver solutions responding to the current challenges, opportunities, and transformations posed by global change in the oceans. This article presents a methodological approach for identifying ocean‐related research outputs and documenting research‐based knowledge integration in documents that inform ocean governance. Specifically, this study builds on an analysis of the references included in the UN Second World Ocean Assessment report to (a) identify and describe the research outputs cited in the distinct chapters of the report, (b) identify research outputs relevant to ocean governance through the analysis of citations from and to references included in the UN Second World Ocean Assessment, (c) compare both datasets to examine the position of the literature cited in the report within a broader ecosystem of ocean‐related research, and (d) present a method to identify topically relevant research that could be integrated in future ocean assessments. Our findings show distinct referencing practices across chapters and expert groups and a higher reliance on high‐profile sources in the report compared to a broader dataset of ocean research outputs. Moreover, this study highlights an innovative approach to identifying ocean research based on knowledge syntheses and considers discussion points about integrating research‐based knowledge in documents informing ocean governance.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

As part of a larger project entitled “Breaking down research silos”, we created a database of research contributions by Canadian LIS researchers (academics and practitioners). This was motivated by a desire to make research by Canadian LIS scholars and practitioners more visible and foster collaboration between these two groups. The aim of this paper is to introduce the database, describe the process through which it was created, provide descriptive statistics of the database content, and highlight areas for future development.\n\n\nRésumé\nL’objectif de la base de données des publications canadiennes en bibliothéconomie et sciences de l’information (BSI) est de contribuer à briser les silos dans lesquels les deux principaux publics cibles – les membres du corps professoral en BSI et les bibliothécaires universitaires – mènent leurs recherches. Dans le cadre d’un projet plus vaste intitulé « Briser les silos de la recherche », nous avons créé une base de données des contributions de recherche des chercheurs canadiens en BSI (universitaires et praticiens). Cette initiative a été motivée par le désir de rendre la recherche des universitaires et praticiens canadiens en BSI plus visible et de favoriser la collaboration entre ces deux groupes. L’objectif de cet article est de présenter la base de données, de décrire le processus de sa création, de fournir des statistiques descriptives sur le contenu de la base de données et de mettre en évidence les opportunités de développement futur.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig1.

    "text": "Research objectives\nOur study was partly inspired by the launch of the CWTS Leiden Ranking Open Edition and its differences with the WoS-based edition. However, our intent is not to compare the two rankings and explain the differences in their outcome, but to compare metadata records for the subset of publications that are indexed in both OpenAlex and WoS, with a focus on describing discrepancies and measuring their frequency. We do not consider WoS as a gold standard against which OpenAlex records should be tested for their quality. Instead, we consider each database as a benchmark for the other. Our research questions are as follows:\n\nRQ1: How frequent are discrepancies between WoS and OpenAlex records in terms of document type, language, publication year, and number of authors?\nRQ2: What share of records with discrepancies are correct in WoS, OpenAlex, neither, or both?\nRQ3: What explains these discrepancies?\n\nThe choice of the metadata elements selected for the study (document type, language, publication year, and number of authors) was guided by their use as factors for inclusion in the CWTS Leiden Ranking: articles and reviews (document type) in English (language) published in a three-year period (publication year). The same metadata are also relevant in the production of normalized indicators for bibliometric research more generally. Indeed, normalized indicators would typically aim to compare publications of the same type, published in the same year. Additionally, the number of authors tends to be the denominator when counting publications using the fractional counting method (also provided in the Leiden Ranking). Therefore, discrepancies in these metadata elements of publication records are more likely to have a direct effect on the outcome of bibliometric analysis.\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the metadata quality of the document type, language, publication year, and author count of the subset of publications indexed in both OpenAlex and WoS. Our findings may offer useful insights to those using or planning to use OpenAlex. They may also point to possible paths to correct metadata errors, which could be helpful for database providers. Our intent is not to establish best practices formulate recommendations for database creators or users, nor to determine whether one database is better than another. Our study is solely motivated by the desire to contribute to a better understanding of our data sources."

We collected all WoS records with a DOI published between 2021 and 2023 (N = 7,661,474). We removed 30,3094 (0.4%) WoS records with multiple document types to avoid complications with the analysis.

Conversely, we collected all OpenAlex records with a DOI and a publication year between 2021 and 2023 (N = 26,942,411). We found 13,618 additional matches to WoS records published outside of the 2021-2023 period, for a total of 6,613,097 records matched. We used the subset of 6,608,243 Web of Science records with a single DOI match in OpenAlex for our analysis.

    "text": "Identification of discrepancies\nFor each matching WoS and OpenAlex record, we compared the following four metadata elements: 1) document type, 2) language, 3) publication year, and 4) number of authors.\nFor the document type, we did not consider discrepancies where a record is a review according to WoS and an article according to OpenAlex, and vice versa (i.e., we consider articles and reviews as the same document type). Furthermore, OpenAlex indexes conference papers as articles, and the source type (conference) is meant to distinguish them from journal articles. For these reasons, we only considered discrepancies for which the record is identified as an article or a review in WoS but not in OpenAlex, or in OpenAlex but not in WoS. We also excluded discrepancies for which the record is a meeting abstract in WoS and an article in OpenAlex, because OpenAlex classifies conference proceedings as articles and relies on the source information to distinguish the two. Overall, we found 429,692 discrepancies that met these criteria (6.5% of all records in the dataset).\nThe identification of discrepancies in language, publication year, and number of authors was limited to the subset of 5,936,235 articles and reviews with no discrepancy in document type (i.e., the records that are articles or reviews in both WoS and OpenAlex). The publication language is recorded in its long form (e.g., English) in our WoS data and its ISO code (e.g., en) in OpenAlex, so we created a list of all language combinations (e.g., English-EN, English-FR), determined which ones constitute discrepancies, and identified 33,516 discrepancies (0.6% of all articles and reviews) in publication language between WoS and OpenAlex.\nThe publication year and number of authors being numeric indicators, identifying discrepancies in these metadata fields is easily done by calculating the difference between the two values and flagging all non-zero values. We identified a total of 480,884 discrepancies (8.1% of all articles and reviews) in publication years and 71,133 discrepancies (1.2% of all articles and reviews) in the number of authors. We recorded them both as dichotomous variables (discrepancy vs no discrepancy) and as numeric differences between the two values, which allowed us to measure both the frequency and the strength of the discrepancies.\nWe obtained the direction and extent of the discrepancies by substracting the OpenAlex publication year or number of author from the WoS values. A difference of 1 indicates that according to WoS the article was published one year (or has one more author) later than according to OpenAlex. Conversely, a difference of -1 indicates that the article was published one year earlier (or has one fewer author) according to WoS than according to OpenAlex. We then grouped cases in the bins (-4 or less, -2 to -3, -1, 1, 2 to 3, 4 or more)."

    "text": "Investigation of discrepancies\nWe took a random sample of discrepancies for manual investigation. For each type of discrepancy, we calculated the required sample size with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of ±5%. The sample discrepancies were manually investigated by looking at the article on the journal’s website and the full text when necessary and available. We recorded whether the WoS or OpenAlex record was correct and, when possible, explained the discrepancy. For the publication year, it is typical for articles to have two publication dates: the date of the first online publication and the date of the publication of the issue. For cases in which the online publication year was recorded in one database and the issue year was recorded in the other, we did not consider either database to be correct.\nFor author discrepancies, the landing page and, when available, the published version were examined for author counts. Where available, author declarations, acknowledgements, and CRediT declarations were also considered to clarify authorship where groups or consortia were involved in the production of the work. For languages, the full text was the primary source, followed by the publisher’s landing page for recording observations on language assignment. We recorded multiple language full texts if available, as well as translated abstracts available on the landing page. There are limitations to using the publisher landing page with a web browser. The language encoding header of the browser’s HTTP GET request could be used by the web server to display the user’s preferred language type, if the server is configured to respond to such a request.\nThis process allowed us to go beyond the simple counting of differences between the databases and gain insight into the different factors that can cause discrepancies and estimate the percentage of erroneous records in each database. One caveat, of course, is that because our process relies on discrepancies to identify errors, we are not considering cases where both databases contain the same error."

Unsurprisingly, the quasi totality of records is in English in both databases. It is important to note, once again, that our results are not meant to reflect the composition of the entire databases, but only the subset of documents included in both. This is expected to underestimate the representation of non-English literature, especially on the OpenAlex side (Simard et al., 2024). Also important to reiterate here is that our WoS data includes only the SCI-E, SSCI, and A&HCI, and not the ESCI, which would include more non-English records.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Distribution of records by language in WoS\n\n\n\nLanguage in WoSRecordsnpctEnglish5,895,51599.31German14,4530.24Spanish7,9690.13French6,1720.10Chinese3,9150.07Russian1,9780.03Portuguese1,5260.03Polish8730.01Japanese7730.01Turkish5800.01Other2,4810.04Total5,936,235100.00\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the dominance of English in the dataset, we also observe differences in the languages that compose the top 10 in each database, as well as in their ranking. Spanish, French, and Portuguese are much more prevalent in the OpenAlex records than in the WoS. On the other hand, Chinese is the 5th most prevalent language in the WoS data, but it does not make the top 10 in OpenAlex, in which we found only 394 articles labelled as Chinese. Since these are supposed to be the same set of records, these differences point to significant discrepancies in the language field between the two databases.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Distribution of records by language in OpenAlex\n\n\n\nLanguage in OpenAlexRecordsnpctEnglish5,886,86499.17Spanish13,7770.23German13,2440.22French10,4660.18Portugese3,2030.05Polish1,0580.02Turkish9090.02Hungarian8410.01Croatian5910.01Romanian5370.01Other3,6530.06Unknown1,0920.02Total5,936,235100.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Discrepancies\nFor this part of the analysis, we focus on articles and reviews that are in English in WoS or in OpenAlex, and in a language other than English in the other database. We do not investigate discrepancies between Portuguese and Spanish or French and German, but only discrepancies for which one of the languages is English (e.g., English-German, English-Chinese).\nTable 7 and Table 8, respectively, display the number of discrepancies found for articles labeled as English in WoS and articles labeled as English in OpenAlex. They also display the number of records manually investigated to determine whether the discrepancies stem from mislabeling non-English content as English, as well as the result of that investigation. To understand how an incorrect assignment may have occurred, we looked at the abstracts and full text on the landing page as well as the full text when it was available. Most sampled works seem to have multi-language abstracts either on the landing page or in the PDF of the full text. Also, some articles are published in multiple languages, meaning that for some of the discrepancies observed, both OpenAlex and WoS are correct.\nA first observation is that WoS appears to be more accurate than OpenAlex in terms of publication language. Table 7 shows that only 20,211 English publications in WoS were in another language according to OpenAlex, and in slightly less than half (49.6%) of the verified cases, the article was in fact in English.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Language discrepancies for articles and reviews in English in WoS\n\n\n\nLanguage in OpenAlexDiscrepanciesSampleErrorsnpctnpctnpctSpanish7,02934.812838.08264.1French5,58027.610130.03130.7Portuguese2,11110.43811.32360.5German1,5987.9267.7830.8Romanian5292.682.400.0Hungarian5202.692.79100.0Turkish4642.361.8583.3Croatian4002.041.200.0Polish2901.430.93100.0Other1,6908.4144.2642.9Total20,211100.0337100.016749.6\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we notice that for some languages, such as French, German, Romanian, and Croatian, the discrepancies correctly flagged articles mislabeled as English in WoS, although the sample sizes for Romanian and Croatian were quite small. On the other hand, the majority of articles labelled as English in WoS and as Spanish, Portuguese, or Turkish in OpenAlex were actually found to be in English.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Language discrepancies for articles and reviews in English in OpenAlex\n\n\n\nLanguage in WoSDiscrepanciesSampleErrorsnpctnpctnpctChinese3,30726.610531.810297.1German2,58920.84513.63782.2Russian1,72313.84914.84693.9French1,33610.7329.732100.0Spanish1,2009.6206.11890.0Japanese6205.0237.023100.0Portuguese4113.3133.91076.9Turkish1311.161.86100.0Polish920.730.93100.0Other1,0368.33410.33397.1Total12,445100.0330100.031093.9"

We obtain the direction and extent of the discrepancies by subtracting the OpenAlex publication year from the WoS publication year. A difference of 1 indicates that the article was published one year later in WoS than according to OpenAlex. Conversely, a difference of -1 indicates that the article was published one year earlier according to WoS than according to OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Number of publication year discrepancies for articles and reviews in WoS and OpenAlex (total and sampled)\n\n\n\nDifference in publication year (WoS - OpenAlex)DiscrepanciesSamplenpctnpct-2 to -32,5490.5205.1-158,52612.2389.61392,68181.727670.12 to 323,1664.8205.1&lt; -32,0690.4205.1Total480,884100.0394100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation for Publication Year Discrepancies\nFrom our investigation of the discrepancies, we observed four general possible publication years that one record can have in either database:\n\nIssue year: the year of the journal issue in which the article is officially published. This is also the year included in the reference to the article.\nFirst publication year: the year in which the article was first published online before it was assigned to an issue.\nOther year: another year that is recorded in the article’s history but is not a publication year (e.g., submission year, accepted year).\nSource unclear: we use this code when the publication year in the WoS or OpenAlex record does not match any of the years listed in the landing page or the PDF.\n\nWe used these four scenarios to group publication year discrepancies between WoS and OpenAlex into six categories. The first two are 1) OA has first year, WoS has issue year, and 2) OA has issue year, WoS has first year. In these cases, we considered both databases to be correct because both dates are actually referring to a publication event. The following four categories indicate errors in one of the databases that include none of the two accepted publication years: 3) OA has other year, 4) OA source unclear, 5) WoS has other year, and 6) WoS source unclear.\nAs shown in Figure 1, erroneous publication years are rare overall in the sample that we analyzed and mostly occur when there are significant discrepancies between the WoS and OpenAlex publication years. However, these errors appear to be more prevalent in OpenAlex. For half of the sampled articles published 2 or 3 years later according to OpenAlex than according to WoS, the source of the OpenAlex publication year was not found on the article landing page or PDF, and appeared to be wrong. This was also the case for 20% of the articles with a publication year in OpenAlex three or more years earlier than in the WoS. In contrast, we only found a few instances (four in total) where the WoS publication year appeared to be erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that discrepancies for which the OpenAlex year is prior to the WoS year are largely explained by cases where OpenAlex has the first publication year and WoS has the issue year, especially when the discrepancy is small (one year). This is expected given that the first publication year is typically before the journal issue year. Inversely, most cases in which the WoS publication year is prior to the OpenAlex publication year are explained by cases where WoS has the first publication year and OpenAlex has the journal issue year. Interestingly, neither database appears to be systematic in the way it indexes the year of first publication or the year of the journal issue."

For these cases, many of the discrepancies are explained by what appears to be a different treatment of group authors by OpenAlex and WoS. As shown in Table 13, OpenAlex appears to be counting as authors each member of the group listed on the byline, but only when that list is displayed on the landing page. However, the group tends to be ignored when its members are not listed on the landing page. WoS usually does not count members of a group listed on the byline as individual authors, regardless of whether or not the names appear on the landing page.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13: Treatment of group authors in WoS and OpenAlex relative to the presence of the list of group members on the landing page.\n\n\n\nGroup authors on landing pageOpenAlexWoSCountedIgnoredCountedIgnoredNo465168Yes3710839\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile group members are typically not counted as authors in WoS, the group itself typically is. For example, a paper with two authors and a group with 10 members will have an author count of 3 in WoS. On the other hand, OpenAlex does not include the group in the author count, so the same paper will typically have an author count of 2 or 12, depending on whether the group members appeared on the landing page.\nFor papers with a group author, OpenAlex and WoS having a different author count for the same paper does not mean that either database contains the correct number of authors. However, for publications that do not have group authors, determining which database has the correct author count is more straightforward. As shown in Table 14, OpenAlex was more likely to be correct (74.8% of the time) in these cases.\n\n\n\n\nTable 14: Number and share of valid records in OpenAlex and WoS in cases of author count discrepancies with no group authors listed on the byline.\n\n\n\nbinSampleOpenAlexWoSnpctnpctnpct&lt; -364.7583.3116.7-2 to -386.3787.5112.5-14434.63988.6511.412620.52388.5311.52 to 32721.31970.4829.6&gt; 31612.6212.51487.5Total127100.09574.83225.2"

Canadian Journal of Academic Librarianship, 11, 1–33. https://doi.org/10.33137/cjal-rcbu.v11.43905\n\n\nAbstract\nBig Deals initially emerged as cost-saving purchasing models through which academic libraries could quickly grow their collections. Over time, the soaring costs of journal bundles have strained library budgets, and librarians have worked to transition away from Big Deals. Cancellation projects are complex processes involving a large amount of time and labour. Past research has examined how librarians use quantitative and/or qualitative data to make decisions around cancellations, but few go inside the process to understand the subjective factors influencing librarians’ choices. This study investigates the decision-making practices and processes of librarians concerned with the cancellation of Big Deals through interviews conducted at four medium-sized Canadian institutions that underwent cancellation projects from 2015 to 2020. The institutions investigated in this study adopted similar practices in deciding what packages to unbundle and selecting their teams. Differences in how qualitative and quantitative data were used in forming analyses, and the communication methods to counteract opposition heavily influenced the relative success of each library. Libraries seemed most successful if they could perform nuanced and complex data analyses, involved their Liaison librarians in faculty consultations, had the strong support of administrators, and wrapped the project together with an integrated communications plan. A model describing the decision-making steps in the process of unbundling journal packages and the influences that impact each step is presented, followed by recommendations for engaging with each influencing factor, based on the findings of this study.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 1.

Although previous studies have shown that institutional environments for conducting research differ significantly between national science systems, disciplines, and subfields, it remains to be shown whether any systematic variations and patterns in inequalities exist among researchers in different national and domain specific settings. This study investigates the positioning of citation elites as opposed to ‘ordinary’ researchers by way of examining three dimensions of concentration (accumulation of publications and citations, specialisation, and institutional concentration) in biology, economics and physics in Denmark and the UK. Across all three dimensions, we put Richard Whitley’s bipartite theory to the test, suggesting a nexus between the intellectual structure of a discipline and the configuration of its elite. The study draws on a dataset of researchers who published most of their publications in either physics, biology, or economics over the 1980–2018 period and with at least one publication in 2017–2018 while affiliated to either a British or a Danish university. We find higher degrees of concentration in the UK compared to Denmark, and that physics and biology respectively display the greatest and lowest degree of concentration. Similar patterns in disciplinary differences are observed in both countries, suggesting that concentration patterns are largely rooted in disciplinary cultures and merely amplified by the national context.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig. 4 Distribution of elite (top 5% most cited) and non-elite scientists across institutions"

Marine Policy, 157, 105829. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105829\n\n\nAbstract\nShark conservation is an urgent and complex biodiversity matter. While research on sharks is an important output of the knowledge production processes that could inform conservation policy and management decisions, whether all relevant knowledge is reaching the public and policy-makers has been questioned. Concerns have been expressed that attention given to research is skewed towards specific and often more sensationalist topics that do not provide an accurate picture of the shark-related issues and of possible solutions to decision-makers and the general public. This study thus analysed Web of Science publications related to sharks to determine the degree of attention different areas of shark-related research received in science, social media, news media, and policy documents. Highly concentrated distributions of citations, and mentions in social media, news media, or policy documents were found, but little relationship exists between the attention that individual publications or research areas receive in the different spheres. These findings show the diversity of shark-related research and its audiences and suggest a need for research evaluation to acknowledge that research impact can take many forms. In addition, developing outreach strategies is needed to ensure that relevant research is adequately disseminated to the public and policy-makers. This study can help researchers, resource managers, and other stakeholders better understand the diverse body of scientific evidence that could be mobilized into policies and practices for shark conservation.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nScientific and media attention to shark research assessed through z-scores of citations, tweets, news, and policy mentions"

Different approaches have been implemented to identify and characterize active scholars on social media platforms like Twitter. Some limitations of past approaches were their complexity and, most importantly, their reliance on licensed scientometric and altmetric data. The emergence of new open data sources such as OpenAlex or Crossref Event Data provides opportunities to identify scholars on social media using only open data. This paper presents a novel and simple approach to match authors from OpenAlex with Twitter users identified in Crossref Event Data. The matching procedure is described and validated with ORCID data. The new approach matches nearly 500,000 matched scholars with their Twitter accounts with a level of high precision and moderate recall.

Using publication data from WoS, OA status from Unpaywall, and annual APC prices from open data sets and historical fees retrieved via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, we estimate that globally authors paid $1.06 billion in publication fees to these publishers from 2015–2018. Revenue from gold OA amounted to $612.5 million, and $448.3 million was obtained for publishing OA in hybrid journals. Among the five publishers, Springer Nature made the most revenue from OA ($589.7 million), followed by Elsevier ($221.4 million), Wiley ($114.3 million), Taylor & Francis ($76.8 million), and Sage ($31.6 million).

Our results support that architecture is becoming increasingly academic, as demonstrated by the growing proportion of articles and journals intended for scholars rather than for professionals. We also show that architecture is increasingly global, with decreased interest in local and/or national issues and the growing prevalence of English as a publication language. Finally, this academic focus is manifested in references cited by architectural papers with the gradual substitution of professional and artistic oriented knowledge, for scientific approaches tied to engineering and technology.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 5.

Its explicit purpose is to address the lack of research on race and inequity within our field. The purpose of this contribution to the issue is to substantiate that statement by performing a bibliometric analysis of the last 40 years of LIS scholarship to quantify the amount of attention given to race and racial inequality over that period. We find that despite an important increase in BIPOC-related research in LIS, the numbers remain quite low with approximately 2% of LIS publications containing terms related to racial inequality and BIPOC communities, and this research also tends to be less cited than the average LIS papers in the same area. We also find that this research is present in several areas of the field, although unevenly distributed across them.

PLOS ONE, 16(5), e0251488. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251488\n\n\nAbstract\nResearch funding is an important factor for public science. Funding may affect which research topics get addressed, and what research outputs are produced. However, funding has often been studied simplistically, using top-down or system-led perspectives. Such approaches often restrict analysis to confined national funding landscapes or single funding organizations and instruments in isolation. This overlooks interlinkages, broader funding researchers might access, and trends of growing funding complexity. This paper instead frames a ‘bottom-up’ approach that analytically distinguishes between increasing levels of aggregation of funding instrument co-use. Funding of research outputs is selected as one way to test this approach, with levels traced via funding acknowledgements (FAs) in papers published 2009–18 by researchers affiliated to Denmark, the Netherlands or Norway, in two test research fields (Food Science, Renewable Energy Research). Three funding aggregation levels are delineated: at the bottom, ‘funding configurations’ of funding instruments co-used by individual researchers (from single-authored papers with two or more FAs); a middle, ‘funding amalgamations’ level, of instruments co-used by collaborating researchers (from multi-authored papers with two or more FAs); and a ‘co-funding network’ of instruments co-used across all researchers active in a research field (all papers with two or more FAs). All three levels are found to include heterogenous funding co-use from inside and outside the test countries. There is also co-funding variety in terms of instrument ‘type’ (public, private, university or non-profit) and ‘origin’ (domestic, foreign or supranational). Limitations of the approach are noted, as well as its applicability for future analyses not using paper FAs to address finer details of research funding dynamics.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 1. Three levels of a bottom-up approach to research funding dynamics. Line thickness between instruments (boxes) of different classes (e.g. type, origin, providing funder) in the co-funding network represents occurrences of instrument classes that have been co-used."

Using data from the Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science Database, this study maps the scholarly contributions of Canadian LIS scholars and academic librarians to the field of LIS and examines whether Canadian LIS research is characterized by silos. This paper examines the similarities and differences in publications, impact, topics, and publication venues between academic librarians and scholars in Canada, as well as the extent to which academics and practitioners engage in research collaborations or reference each other’s work. Now published in the Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science, the full study can be read here.\nHe also presented a work-in-progress by himself, Madelaine Hare, Geoff Krause, Rebecca Marjoram, Poppy Riddle, Rémi Toupin, and Summer Wilson entitled “Investigating Document Type Discrepancies between OpenAlex and the Web of Science”, which aims to assess the metadata quality of works in OpenAlex and the Web of Science.\nLearn more about and become a member of CAIS/ACSI at the association’s website.

Their project, entitled, ’Aligning scholarly and public understanding of ocean knowledge: An assessment based on the UN Second World Ocean Assessment Report’aims to map oceans research synthesized in the UN Second World Ocean Assessment Report, an exhaustive corpus of oceans knowledge. Specifically, they seek to identify scholarly outputs and map the research areas and scientific actors associated with topics and issues in ocean science, and measure attention to research areas from scholarly and non-scholarly audiences and stakeholders. We will assess how attention to research about the oceans is distributed across scholarly communities, policy, news media, and social media. Discrepancies of attention to research areas in relation to social and topical dynamics will be exposed, such as whether certain topics are discussed more because they are deemed more attractive by the media, leveraged by policymakers towards certain ends, or due to imbalance of attention resources in research clusters. This will propel tactical responses to knowledge and capacity-building gaps and key areas of oceans research, the mobilization of resources and knowledge production where it is most needed, and lay the groundwork for more effectively bridging the science-policy-public interface.\nThe OFI Seed Fund provides financial support and expertise for ocean-related projects that demonstrate a high potential to grow into larger externally funded research projects or to deliver their impact through commercialization.\nLearn more about other Dalhousie projects funded by the OFI Seed Fund.\nStay up to date on QSSLab projects here."

Three members of QSSLab will be presenting their work at the conference as well as participating in the student research forum.\nGeoff Krause will be presenting the work “Measuring Data Reuse in OpenAlex by Researchers, Institutions, and Countries”. Abstract: Open Data is a concept that is receiving increased attention and support in academic environments, with one justification being that shared data may be reused in further research. But what evidence exists for such reuse, and what is the relationship between the producers of shared datasets and researchers making use of them? This work in progress makes use of dataset citations in the OpenAlex bibliometric database to analyze the relationship between the creators of datasets and authors who cite them, at individual, institutional, and national levels.\nMarc-André Simard will be presenting the work “The value of a diamond: Understanding global coverage of diamond Open Access journals in Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenAlex to support an open future”. Abstract: Open Data is a concept that is receiving increased attention and support in academic environments, with one justification being that shared data may be reused in further research.

This work in progress makes use of dataset citations in the OpenAlex bibliometric database to analyze the relationship between the creators of datasets and authors who cite them, at individual, institutional, and national levels.\nPoppy Riddle will be presenting the work “The use of institutional Repository for self-archiving in Canadian Universities”. Abstract: This study investigates the use of institutional repositories (IR) for self-archiving journal articles in the U15 universities as well as the presence of institutional policies and publisher embargoes. While 45.1% to 56.6% of publications are available in open access (OA), only 0.5% to 10.7% are found in the IRs. We found only three university-wide OA policies, and embargo periods of 12 months or more for 25.6% of journal policies. This suggests that IRs play a minor role in OA practices, and a need for more policies related to self-archiving and the use of IRs specifically.\nFind the official conference program here. Additionally, the CAIS Annual General Meeting will conclude the conference on Friday, June 9th; consider attending and participating in the vibrant Canadian Information Science community!\nThe theme of this year’s conference is “Imagining Information”: attendees are invited to consider imagining in its many senses and forms, from imagining potential futures for the field and our society, to the nature and function of imagination in information experiences and phenomena. We are delighted that our lab members are contributing their expertise and thoughtful perspectives to imagining better futures for the IS field and for society."

    "section": "",
    "text": "QSS Lab is looking forward to welcoming Rémi Toupin back to Halifax this spring. Remi is starting two years at Dalhousie as a FRQSC postdoctoral fellow. Here we profile Remi, learn about his recently completed thesis, and find out what projects he will be working on at the lab!\nRémi, tell us about your doctoral thesis! What interested you in the subject and inspired you to dive deeper into this project?\nFor my thesis, I worked on the contexts of climate change research circulation on Twitter. Specifically, I aimed to better understand how altmetrics and traces left by scholarly documents on Twitter could be used to examine the public attention to scientific articles about climate change. I looked at this by focusing on who tweeted scientific articles, their interactions in terms of retweets and mentions, as well as their resonance to said articles, that is the way users eventually relate to scientific articles through their experience of the world.\nI initially began my PhD because I wanted to do something that involved research about scientific communication and why it is so relevant. During my master’s degree in anthropology, I began to be involved in various initiatives to get a broader public interested in archaeological research… and why it was relevant to do archaeological research. This happened about at the same time as the 2012 Quebec student protests during I which I started to get more socially and politically involved, especially regarding environmental issues. I felt, and still believe, that reducing our footprint on nature is critical to leave the world a better place.\nSo, my thesis was initially on the use of social medias to communicate the scientific aspects of environmental issues… which is quite a big topic! Gradually, I started to increasingly focus on Twitter, mostly because it was heralded as a key environment for the communication of scholarly articles and the development of altmetrics. I also got more critical of social media and metrics in general and wanted to do something that focused on the more qualitative aspects of the public communication of research, specifically how does it relate to those that are involved in it.\nWhat are the different research projects you are working on and what are you most looking forward to working on over the course of your postdoc?\nI have a few projects already going on with QSSLab for my postdoc. As for the fellowship I obtain from the Fonds de recherche du Québec, I’ll work on the gap between scholarly and public attention to marine conservation research. The general goal is to measure which topics in marine conservation research get the most visibility across various indicators like citations, tweets, policy mentions and the news, and better understand why some topics get more or less public attention, specifically in relation to their importance in the scientific literature. We already did kind of a pilot project about the scholarly-public attention gap in shark research, but I’ll look to expand it to other topics.\nI am also looking forward to work on various projects that involve scientific information and environmental issues. One such project involves helping with the bibliometric assessment of GESAMP (Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Protection) reports. I’ll also look to expand some of the work done during my thesis and how we can think differently about the societal impact of research.\nWhat are you most looking forward to working in the QSS Lab and/or living in Halifax?\nTo meet the team! I had a lot of fun the last I came to Halifax and I’m looking forward to just be a part of the team at the QSSLab. Also, the fact that marine conservation and environmental information have are key research topics at Dal means I picked a great environment for my project. I hope to get involve in some science communication initiatives if I can.\nOtherwise, my plan is to enjoy the city and its surroundings as best I can with the people at the QSSLab! Whether it’s exploring various coastal environments on the South Shore or Cape Breton – something I oddly didn’t really experience much before last year, although I have been fascinated by the ocean since my childhood – or enjoying the local culture and city life, I want to make the most of my life in Halifax for the next two years."

    "text": "Research activities are a large part of the work of university librarians. However, their work often suffers from a lack of visibility, resulting in untapped potential for exchange and collaboration between librarians and researchers in information science. This project aims to help break down the silos in which the two primary target audiences- information science researchers and academic librarians- conduct their research. Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science makes visible the work that librarians do and allows other Canadian researchers to discover the research of their colleagues. We hope that this will stimulate increased collaboration amongst university librarians and researchers across Canada.\nThis project consists of a database and an open citation index, listing the research contributions of Canadian librarians and researchers in information sciences. This dataset and its source code is made available through this GitHub repository. It contains two CSV files; one of LIS authors, and their publications. These datasets are also available on Zenodo here. For those interesting in contributing, you may do so through the GitHub repository.\nAlso available is an interactive platform which allows users to view and export publications. In the future, it will also allow users to contribute to the completeness and quality of the data by proposing additions or modifications. This tool will promote and explore research in information science in Canada and help break down the walls that separate librarians and researchers by making them aware of the results of their respective research. This database will be updated annually with new publications.\nThis project is part of a larger SSHRC funded project of workshops and conferences and provides a means to explore a database of publications from the information science community in Canada. The website LIS Canada, available here will also provide access to these tools.\nThis project was carried out by two teams from Dalhousie University (QSS Lab) and the University of Montreal, in partnership with the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL), the Maritime Institute on Science, Technology and Society (MISTS) and the School of Library and Information Science (EBSI) of the University of Montreal. The project is directly linked to CARL’s mission to improve the contribution of librarians to research and higher education, to foster the efficiency and sustainability of the creation, dissemination and preservation of knowledge, and to promote access to research results. It is also linked to the activities of the MISTS, which offers support for research on science and its relations with society, in particular by providing researchers with a technological infrastructure designed for bibliometric research."

Both Poppy Riddle and Geoff Krause were awarded Best Student Paper. Congratulations to Poppy and Geoff for their outstanding presentations and research!\nGeoff Krause presented the study “Who re-uses data? A bibliometric analysis of data citations and the relationship between authors and data creators” (Krause, G., Bowman, T., Rosati, D., Mongeon, P., & Smit, M.) It is widely recognized that open science has widespread benefits not only for science and society, but also for individual researchers (McKiernan et al., 2016). A study by Drachen et al. (2016) suggested that papers get more citations when the underlying data is made available. But when data is re-used, are the datasets themselves being cited, and if so, by whom? Past studies that investigated citations to datasets found that formal data citations are generally rare (Peters et al., 2016; Robinson-García et al., 2016), and observed field differences in data citation practices (Peters et al., 2016). There have also been attempts to link data creators to researchers in order to capture data sharing practices and incorporate them into the reward system of science (Mongeon et al., 2017). A previous study by Dudek, Mongeon and Bergmans (2019) analyzed citations to datasets from the IFREMER and found that most of those citations came from researchers affiliated with the organization, and that 75% of the citing papers had at least one author in common with the dataset. This project increases on the scale of their work by analyzing citations to 474,609 datasets, and the relationship between the citing authors and the creators of the 30,582 datasets with at least one citation. This is, to their knowledge, the first analysis to provide large-scale empirical insights on data re-use with a focus on data self-citations.\nPoppy Riddle presented her work “The use of institutional repositories for green Open Access in Canadian universities” (Riddle, P., Simard, M-A., Gone, P., Li, V., & Mongeon, P.) This study investigates the use of institutional repositories (IR) for self-archiving journal articles in the U15 universities as well as the presence of institutional policies and publisher embargos. While 45.1% to 56.6% of publications are available in open access (OA), only 0.5% to 10.7% are found in the IRs. We found only three university-wide OA policies, and embargo periods of 12 months or more for 25.6% of journal policies. This suggests that IRs play a minor role in OA practices, and a need for more policies related to self-archiving and the use of IRs specifically.\nSee the official announcement on the ASIS&T website, here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Poppy Riddle is a doctoral student in the Dalhousie Interdisciplinary PhD (IDPhD) program where she combines her interests in library and information science (LIS) and human-computer interaction (HCI). This profile highlights the extension of Poppy’s thesis research in the Master of Information (MI) program into her PhD research, current projects she is working on, and her experience working in the QSS lab!\nPoppy, what was your MI thesis topic? What interested you in the subject and inspired you to dive deeper?\nMy thesis looked at how keywords from peer-reviewed articles might be useful to compare two search terms during the exploratory search phase. I used a visualization to show how the keywords overlap in two search results. At the time, this was just a static visualization and a demonstration of the concept. However, I’m still working towards making this a working application to be used in a user study.\nThere was an article I read by Devon Greyson on ignorance and a call to revive agnatology as part of a reflective process on what information we include, exclude, or don’t know about. As the search interfaces we use in libraries return list based results, I can’t really see what I’m missing or I don’t know about. Coming from an art and design background, I’m used to using visual tools to explore and gain knowledge about complex things. What if our ability to search in libraries was augmented by a visual mode for exploration? Would I be able to be more aware of what articles or books I’m choosing and not choosing?\nHow has your thinking and research evolved since you began the IDPhD program? What are the different research projects you are working on and what are you most looking forward to digging into more over the course of your doctoral degree?\nSo, it turns out this is a much deeper problem and I’m learning so much in the PhD program about how other fields can inform and shape this problem. I’m working in both LIS and HCI fields right now and both are highly interdisciplinary. I’m learning cognitive science concepts, theories of cognition and emotion, ethnographic methods, user interface design and evaluation methods, natural language processing, virtual and augmented reality, immersive visualization and analytics, and of course more explorations in coding and the technical aspects of creating prototype applications. All of these, (just in my first year) are shaping, guiding, and clarifying my desire for a visual search interface.\nI’ve been working on a quite a wide range of research from investigating open access and institutional repositories, LIS research in Canadian institutions, learning more about the OpenAlex database and mapping its contents, designing and learning to create applications, virtual reality authentication using graphical passwords, and contributing to course development in bibliometrics and data science. As varied as they seem, there is a thread joins all this together, albeit a very long one! However, despite all I’m learning, I’m really exicted for next year as I’ll be able to focus on my research and making visual search interfaces!\nCongratulations on receiving the CARL research grant! Could you tell us a bit about the project you are working on?\nThe CARL research grant was awarded based on my masters thesis and the gap in understanding how visual metaphors of graphs, charts, maps, or networks affect viewers. This project is still being shaped by what I’m learning in coursework and the technical challenges of creating different ways of representing the data. I’m anticipating running the study in the summer.\nWhat do you enjoy most about LIS/HCI?\nHCI is a great overlap between my prior education in design and LIS, though HCI goes deep into the user research theory and methods. I find this both satisfying and daunting! I think there is also a good complement between HCI and LIS in theories and methods that are unique to each, but may cross over well. For example, cognition theories that HCI borrows from cognitive science may help LIS researchers understand how technological systems are shaping the perception and decision making of library patrons. Conversely, HCI seems to lack the critical perspectives that LIS brings to address social inequities and would benefit from reflective practices in identifying how design processes, theories, contexts, etc are continuing to enable inequalities and bias.\nFinally, what are your favourite parts about QSS Lab?\nThe people! Perhaps its our curiosity, our shared ability to geek about anything, or how satisfying it is to hear about other’s successes. Its such a wonderfully supportive community. Second, I really like the breadth of our research topics. There’s technical work, (which can be really deep and satisfying), and there’s critical work of deconstructing, (which can be personally rewarding), and topics that genuinely interest me as well as those that are surprisingly interesting! ( I think anything can be interesting if you ask the right questions.)\nCompared with prior professional experience, our QSS group and SIM as a whole are quite unique. There is a real chemistry at work that support collaboration, thoughtfulness, critical thinking, and communal goodwill. So, its quite unique and special in my opinion. I plan on being here for quite some time, thank you very much."

His project aims to propose measures of the scope of academic journals and to explore the relationship between the scope and other journal characteristics such as the field, the type of publisher, the publishing model, age, and Impact Factor.\nRebecca Marjoram, Master of Information student, was awarded the scholarship for her thesis entitled “Privilege in publishing: Investigating the impact of scientific reputation and sociodemographic factors on peer review outcomes”. Her project asks: If you’re a researcher who has been publishing in your field for years, you have a high number of citations, and loads of publications to your name, do you really need to fit the scope of a journal to publish in it? Or do you get to lead the discourse of the community? Those are some of the questions this project seeks to answer. We’re going to determine the scope of the top journals across 174 scientific sub-fields and see what impact academic reputation and other sociodemographic factors have (e.g. Inferred gender, inferred ethnicity) on the need for authors to fit the scope of a journal in order to be accepted for publication.\nCoalition Publica is a partnership between Érudit and the Public Knowledge Project which supports the social sciences and humanities journal community in the transition towards sustainable open access. Their mission is to help develop and coordinate an open and sustainable national infrastructure supporting research dissemination and digital scholarly publishing in Canada.

Philippe Mongeon, one of the leads of Cluster 3.2, and members of the QSSLab will be involved in four work packages, in collaboration with Dalhousie’s Faculty of Computer Science and the Université du Québec à Rimouski.\nWork Package 1: Oceans and climate: identifying knowledge and its structure\nThis work package has two main objectives: to identify scholarly literature on the role of oceans in relation to climate and to analyze the structure and evolution of this research over time using research clusters. It aims to build a global overview of ocean-climate research, supporting both internal projects and informing broader climate policy, like the IPCC reports. Through hierarchical clustering and machine learning, the project will classify knowledge within this corpus, creating tools for future research. Collaboration between Dalhousie University’s Information Science and Computer Science faculties will help ensure the development of a robust knowledge navigation and classification system.\nWork Package 2: The evolution of scholarly and public attention toward ocean-climate research\nThis work package builds on WP1 by examining how ocean-climate research is mobilized across different platforms, including scientific literature, social media, news, policy, and educational materials. Its aim is to determine who engages with this knowledge, the contexts of its citations, and how different geographical or topical clusters generate attention. By mapping knowledge flows, this study will identify which research is visible to key organizations like NGOs and explore how knowledge is disseminated across different audiences. The project will also develop visualization tools to track the movement of knowledge and provide insights into how external events, such as COVID-19, affect knowledge structures, feeding into WP3’s analysis of the drivers of knowledge dissemination.\nWork Package 3: The shaping of the ocean-climate research landscape\nWork Package 3 focuses on understanding the evolution of ocean-climate research by analyzing knowledge flows over time, using bibliometrics and generative AI. It aims to identify how world events, political actions, and social shifts impact the production and dissemination of research, while also exploring hidden causalities in the knowledge landscape. The project will develop tools to assess gaps in the current knowledge base, predict future research directions, and generate targeted actions to address under-explored areas, with an emphasis on equity and inclusion. Generative AI will also be leveraged to hypothesize future knowledge flows, shape research initiatives, and support multi-language accessibility.\nWork Package 4: Mapping curriculum and the scientific landscape\nThis work package builds on previous efforts to connect ocean and climate science with educational syllabi, focusing on Atlantic Canadian secondary and post-secondary educators. The project aims to analyze the gap between scientific literature and its representation in regional curricula, understand who is and isn’t represented in the scientific works used in education, and develop tools that help educators access relevant research. Through bibliometric analysis and information science methodologies, the project seeks to empower educators to effectively teach ocean-climate science, with particular emphasis on marginalized communities. Collaboration between Dalhousie University and UQAR will ensure interdisciplinary expertise, community partnerships, and the development of participatory, user-friendly tools.\nTo learn more about different research clusters within TCA and the program’s expected impact, visit the Ocean Frontier Institutes’ website."

However, there is a lack of research that examines these activities, particularly at the author level. This paper explores the activity of researchers in the Twittersphere by analyzing a large database of Web of Science authors systematically identified on Twitter using data from Altmetric.com. Using this information, this paper explores and compares patterns of tweeted and self-tweeted publications with other academic activities, such as citations, self citations, and authorship at the author level. This paper also compares the thematic orientation among these different activities by analyzing the similarity of the research topics of the publications tweeted, cited, and authored. The results show that the productivity and impact of researchers, as defined by conventional bibliometric indicators, are not correlated to their popularity on the Twitter platform and that scholars generally tend to tweet about topics closely related to the publications they author and cite. These findings suggest that social media metrics capture a broader aspect of the academic workflow that is most likely related to science communication, dissemination, and engagement with wider audiences and that differs from conventional forms of impact as captured by citations. Areas for further exploration are also proposed.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nSpearman correlations of the main scientometric and Twitter indicators"

Studies have shown that nearly half of the contemporary scientific literature could be available online for free. However, few studies have compared the use of OA literature across countries. This study aims to provide a global picture of OA adoption by countries, using two indicators: publications in OA and references made to articles in OA. We find that, on average, low-income countries are publishing and citing OA at the highest rate, while upper middle-income countries and higher-income countries publish and cite OA articles at below world-average rates. These results highlight national differences in OA uptake and suggest that more OA initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are needed to support wider adoption of open scholarship.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig 1.

Investigating the relationship between tweeting and citing research articles. Quantitative Science Studies, 5(2), 332‑350. https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00296\n\n\nAbstract\nThe last decade of altmetrics research has demonstrated that altmetrics have a low to moderate correlation with citations, depending on the platform and the discipline, among other factors. Most past studies used academic works as their unit of analysis to determine whether the attention they received on Twitter was a good predictor of academic engagement. Our work revisits the relationship between tweets and citations where the tweet itself is the unit of analysis, and the question is to determine if, at the individual level, the act of tweeting an academic work can shed light on the likelihood of the act of citing that same work. We model this relationship by considering the research activity of the tweeter and its relationship to the tweeted work. The results show that tweeters are more likely to cite works affiliated with their same institution, works published in journals in which they also have published, and works in which they hold authorship. It finds that the older the academic age of a tweeter the less likely they are to cite what they tweet, though there is a positive relationship between citations and the number of works they have published and references they have accumulated over time.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nCitation rates by sociotopical characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nDataset"

Interference in science: Scientists’ perspectives on their ability to communicate and conduct environmental research in Canada. FACETS, 8, 1–31. https://doi.org/10.1139/facets-2023-0005\n\n\nAbstract\nWhen researchers are sufficiently resourced to conduct research and communicate their findings, the knowledge produced can benefit the environment and society through policy. However, interference with the research process and its subsequent knowledge mobilization (“interference in science”) has been observed in several countries, particularly for environmental researchers. Using a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed environmental researchers in Canada (n = 741) to investigate the perceived prevalence, source, and effects of interference and considered whether these perceptions differ by region, career stage, research area, and membership in any scientific society. Although over half of researchers were not restricted from speaking to the media (54%), and most had never been asked to make “undue modifications” to their work (84%), the vast majority (92%) reported at least some degree of interference in their work during their careers. Consequences of interference were more prevalent among early-career researchers and included negative impacts on job satisfaction, mental health, and undue modification to work leading to inaccurate or incomplete science communication. Although environmental researchers in Canada deem themselves overall better able to conduct and communicate their work than under previous federal governments, reports of ongoing political interference remain concerning. We recommend increased support for researchers and further investigations into interference.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFig. 6.

    "text": "Citation\nMadsen, E. B., Mongeon, P., & Schneider, J. W. (2025). Gender disparity in funding rates in double-blind grant peer review: The case of the Villum Experiment. Quantitative Science Studies, 1–22. https://doi.org/10.1162/qss.a.5\n\n\nAbstract\nThe Villum Experiment (VEX) is one of the few funding schemes that employs a double-blind review process where applicants are blinded to reviewers, applications are highly standardized, reviewers do not deliberate, and funding is determined solely by ranked aggregated review scores. This unique controlled setting enables assumptions that direct reviewer gender bias is highly unlikely. Using a causal framework (DAG), we examine the extent to which gender disparities in funding may exist in such a setting. Our analyses of 2,041 applications from five funding rounds (2017–2021) reveal a small but consistent gender disparity in success rates, concentrated within the Life Science panel. As reviewer bias is unlikely in this setting, these disparities or structural inequalities are likely caused by differences in gender compositions across disciplines and the underrepresentation of highly experienced women among the applicants and in the population in general. Multilevel modeling with post-stratification indicates that accounting for these structural factors removes the disparity in funding success rates. Our findings highlight that gender disparity in funding may remain without direct review bias. In this case, such remaining disparities are likely rooted in broader structural inequalities within academia and/or compositional effects.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The causal model. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) illustrating the proposed causal mechanisms that can lead to gendered differences in success rates for the Villum Experiment fund ing scheme. The dashed arrow from gender to funding illustrates that blinded reviews should ideally remove the potential direct effect, as gender bias in reviews is rendered impossible. Purple nodes are intermediate variables signifying different indirect effects from gender to funding outcome. Potential indirect effects are represented in the DAG as paths through purple nodes. The gray node is an unobserved, possibly confounding, factor."

A Bibliometric Analysis of Canadian LIS Scholars and Practitioners’ Research Contributions. The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science / La Revue canadienne des sciences de l’information et de bibliothéconomie, 48(1), 20–35. https://doi.org/10.5206/cjils-rcsib.v48i1.22439\n\n\nAbstract\nCanada’s research productivity in Library and Information Science (LIS) is significant: studies have found that Canada ranks third globally in terms of output. As the LIS field continues to grow, the pace of output accelerates, and the scope of this work expands. The recently launched Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science Database compiles all Canadian scientific publications, including those authored by faculty members and academic librarians. This database offers the advantage of encompassing articles and librarian publications that may not be typically included in traditional bibliometric surveys, such as those conducted using databases like Web of Science, Scopus, and Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). Using this data, this study maps the scholarly contributions of Canadian LIS scholars and academic librarians to the field of LIS and examines whether Canadian LIS research is characterized by silos. This paper examines the similarities and differences in research output, impact, topics, and publication venues between academic librarians and scholars in Canada, as well as the extent to which academics and practitioners engage in research collaborations or reference each other’s work. We find that while there is some degree of overlap in research topics and publication venues between LIS academics and academic librarians, the two groups appear to act as distinct research communities with distinct topical foci and publishing habits. The two groups also do not appear to engage with each other strongly, either through collaboration or citing each other’s work.\n\n\nRésumé\nLa productivité de la recherche au Canada en bibliothéconomie et sciences de l’information (BSI) est significative : des études ont révélé que le Canada se classe au troisième rang mondial en termes de production. À mesure que le domaine continue de croître, le rythme de production s’accélère et la portée de ce travail s’élargit. La base de données récemment lancée des Publications canadiennes en bibliothéconomie et sciences de l’information compile les publications de membres du corps professoral et de bibliothécaires universitaires au Canada. Cette base de données offre l’avantage d’inclure des articles et des publications de bibliothécaires qui ne sont pas toujours inclus dans les enquêtes bibliométriques traditionnelles, telles que celles menées à l’aide de bases de données comme Web of Science, Scopus et Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). En utilisant ces données, cette étude cartographie les contributions scientifiques des chercheurs canadiens en BSI et des bibliothécaires universitaires au domaine et examine si la recherche canadienne en LIS est caractérisée par des silos. Cet article examine les similitudes et les différences dans la production de recherche, l’impact, les sujets et les lieux de publication entre les bibliothécaires universitaires et les chercheurs au Canada, ainsi que la mesure dans laquelle les universitaires et les praticiens s’engagent dans des collaborations de recherche ou se réfèrent aux travaux des uns et des autres. Nous constatons que, bien qu’il existe un certain degré de chevauchement dans les sujets de recherche et les lieux de publication entre les universitaires en LIS et les bibliothécaires universitaires, les deux groupes semblent constituer des communautés de recherche distinctes avec des focalisations thématiques et des habitudes de publication distinctes. Les deux groupes ne semblent pas non plus intéragir fortement tant au niveau de la collaboration qu’au niveau des citations.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nDistribution of venues by share of articles authored by academics"

Examining the geographic and linguistic coverage of gold and diamond open access journals in OpenAlex, Scopus and Web of Science. Quantitative Science Studies, 1–29. https://doi.org/10.1162/QSS.a.1\n\n\nAbstract\nDiamond open access (OA) is a publishing model that is free for both authors and readers, but its lack of indexing in major bibliographic databases compared to gold journals presents challenges in assessing its uptake. Furthermore, the characteristics of diamond journals, such as language and country of publication, have often been used to support the argument that they are more diverse and serve national research communities. However, there is a notable lack of empirical evidence regarding their geographical and linguistic characteristics. Using the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) as a benchmark, this paper investigates OA journals through their coverage in OpenAlex, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus by field, country, and language. The results show the lower coverage of diamond journals in WoS and Scopus and confirm the national scope of diamond journals compared to gold. The share of English-only journals is considerably higher among gold journals in every database. High-income countries have the highest share of authorship in every domain and type of journal, except for diamond journals in the social sciences and humanities. Understanding the current landscape of diamond OA indexing can aid the scholarly communications community and decision-makers in advancing policy and practices toward more inclusive OA models.\n\n\nKey figures\n\n\n\nShare of journals by language, domain, and OA type.\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of journals by publishing country, domain, and OA type\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nFull paper\nCode"
