    "text": "Dalhousie University’s Ocean Frontier Institute launched the Transforming Climate Action (TCA) research program in 2023. Philippe Mongeon, one of the leads of Cluster 3.2, and members of the QSSLab will be involved in four work packages, in collaboration with Dalhousie’s Faculty of Computer Science and the Université du Québec à Rimouski.\nWork Package 1: Oceans and climate: identifying knowledge and its structure\nThis work package has two main objectives: to identify scholarly literature on the role of oceans in relation to climate and to analyze the structure and evolution of this research over time using research clusters. It aims to build a global overview of ocean-climate research, supporting both internal projects and informing broader climate policy, like the IPCC reports. Through hierarchical clustering and machine learning, the project will classify knowledge within this corpus, creating tools for future research. Collaboration between Dalhousie University’s Information Science and Computer Science faculties will help ensure the development of a robust knowledge navigation and classification system.\nWork Package 2: The evolution of scholarly and public attention toward ocean-climate research\nThis work package builds on WP1 by examining how ocean-climate research is mobilized across different platforms, including scientific literature, social media, news, policy, and educational materials. Its aim is to determine who engages with this knowledge, the contexts of its citations, and how different geographical or topical clusters generate attention. By mapping knowledge flows, this study will identify which research is visible to key organizations like NGOs and explore how knowledge is disseminated across different audiences. The project will also develop visualization tools to track the movement of knowledge and provide insights into how external events, such as COVID-19, affect knowledge structures, feeding into WP3’s analysis of the drivers of knowledge dissemination.\nWork Package 3: The shaping of the ocean-climate research landscape\nWork Package 3 focuses on understanding the evolution of ocean-climate research by analyzing knowledge flows over time, using bibliometrics and generative AI. It aims to identify how world events, political actions, and social shifts impact the production and dissemination of research, while also exploring hidden causalities in the knowledge landscape. The project will develop tools to assess gaps in the current knowledge base, predict future research directions, and generate targeted actions to address under-explored areas, with an emphasis on equity and inclusion. Generative AI will also be leveraged to hypothesize future knowledge flows, shape research initiatives, and support multi-language accessibility.\nWork Package 4: Mapping curriculum and the scientific landscape\nThis work package builds on previous efforts to connect ocean and climate science with educational syllabi, focusing on Atlantic Canadian secondary and post-secondary educators. The project aims to analyze the gap between scientific literature and its representation in regional curricula, understand who is and isn’t represented in the scientific works used in education, and develop tools that help educators access relevant research. Through bibliometric analysis and information science methodologies, the project seeks to empower educators to effectively teach ocean-climate science, with particular emphasis on marginalized communities. Collaboration between Dalhousie University and UQAR will ensure interdisciplinary expertise, community partnerships, and the development of participatory, user-friendly tools.\nTo learn more about different research clusters within TCA and the program’s expected impact, visit the Ocean Frontier Institutes’ website."

    "text": "Congratulations to Geoff Krause (IDPhD) and Rebecca Marjoram (MI), 2024 Coalition Publica scholarship recipients!\nGeoff Krause is an Interdisciplinary PhD student based in the Department of Information Science. He was awarded funding for his project “Defining the scope of academic journals through computational text analysis”. His project aims to propose measures of the scope of academic journals and to explore the relationship between the scope and other journal characteristics such as the field, the type of publisher, the publishing model, age, and Impact Factor.\nRebecca Marjoram, Master of Information student, was awarded the scholarship for her thesis entitled “Privilege in publishing: Investigating the impact of scientific reputation and sociodemographic factors on peer review outcomes”. Her project asks: If you’re a researcher who has been publishing in your field for years, you have a high number of citations, and loads of publications to your name, do you really need to fit the scope of a journal to publish in it? Or do you get to lead the discourse of the community? Those are some of the questions this project seeks to answer. We’re going to determine the scope of the top journals across 174 scientific sub-fields and see what impact academic reputation and other sociodemographic factors have (e.g. Inferred gender, inferred ethnicity) on the need for authors to fit the scope of a journal in order to be accepted for publication.\nCoalition Publica is a partnership between Érudit and the Public Knowledge Project which supports the social sciences and humanities journal community in the transition towards sustainable open access. Their mission is to help develop and coordinate an open and sustainable national infrastructure supporting research dissemination and digital scholarly publishing in Canada. They are proud to support students at the Masters and PhD levels to apply digital humanities methods to Coalition Publica’s textual corpus or to study the scholarly communication ecosystem.\nRead the full announcement here.

Philippe Mongeon and Rémi Toupin have been awarded a Partnership Engagement Grant from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) for the project The mobilization of scientific expertise through grey literature: the case of GESAMP. With this grant, the research team will investigate the reach and visibility of reports produced by the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection), an advisory body to the UN on matters of marine environmental protection. This project is a partnership with GESAMP, the QSSLab, and the Environmental Information Use and Influence (EIUI) research group located at Dalhousie University.\nA first study published in 2004 by MacDonald, Cordes, and Wells’, “Grey literature in the life of GESAMP, an international marine scientific advisory body”, provides an outline of what this research hopes to recreate with updated tools and bibliometric methodology. This analysis of GESAMP in grey literature illuminated the publication and diffusion of GESAMP reports. Expanding this project in the current context will be helpful for GESAMP as they align their work with the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and address current challenges identified in their working plan. This project will use bibliometric methods to measure the engagement of GESAMP with the scientific literature and the engagement with GESAMP reports and publications inside and outside the scientific realm, especially for policy-making."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Poppy Riddle is a doctoral student in the Dalhousie Interdisciplinary PhD (IDPhD) program where she combines her interests in library and information science (LIS) and human-computer interaction (HCI). This profile highlights the extension of Poppy’s thesis research in the Master of Information (MI) program into her PhD research, current projects she is working on, and her experience working in the QSS lab!\nPoppy, what was your MI thesis topic? What interested you in the subject and inspired you to dive deeper?\nMy thesis looked at how keywords from peer-reviewed articles might be useful to compare two search terms during the exploratory search phase. I used a visualization to show how the keywords overlap in two search results. At the time, this was just a static visualization and a demonstration of the concept. However, I’m still working towards making this a working application to be used in a user study.\nThere was an article I read by Devon Greyson on ignorance and a call to revive agnatology as part of a reflective process on what information we include, exclude, or don’t know about. As the search interfaces we use in libraries return list based results, I can’t really see what I’m missing or I don’t know about. Coming from an art and design background, I’m used to using visual tools to explore and gain knowledge about complex things. What if our ability to search in libraries was augmented by a visual mode for exploration? Would I be able to be more aware of what articles or books I’m choosing and not choosing?\nHow has your thinking and research evolved since you began the IDPhD program? What are the different research projects you are working on and what are you most looking forward to digging into more over the course of your doctoral degree?\nSo, it turns out this is a much deeper problem and I’m learning so much in the PhD program about how other fields can inform and shape this problem. I’m working in both LIS and HCI fields right now and both are highly interdisciplinary. I’m learning cognitive science concepts, theories of cognition and emotion, ethnographic methods, user interface design and evaluation methods, natural language processing, virtual and augmented reality, immersive visualization and analytics, and of course more explorations in coding and the technical aspects of creating prototype applications. All of these, (just in my first year) are shaping, guiding, and clarifying my desire for a visual search interface.\nI’ve been working on a quite a wide range of research from investigating open access and institutional repositories, LIS research in Canadian institutions, learning more about the OpenAlex database and mapping its contents, designing and learning to create applications, virtual reality authentication using graphical passwords, and contributing to course development in bibliometrics and data science. As varied as they seem, there is a thread joins all this together, albeit a very long one! However, despite all I’m learning, I’m really exicted for next year as I’ll be able to focus on my research and making visual search interfaces!\nCongratulations on receiving the CARL research grant! Could you tell us a bit about the project you are working on?\nThe CARL research grant was awarded based on my masters thesis and the gap in understanding how visual metaphors of graphs, charts, maps, or networks affect viewers. This project is still being shaped by what I’m learning in coursework and the technical challenges of creating different ways of representing the data. I’m anticipating running the study in the summer.\nWhat do you enjoy most about LIS/HCI?\nHCI is a great overlap between my prior education in design and LIS, though HCI goes deep into the user research theory and methods. I find this both satisfying and daunting! I think there is also a good complement between HCI and LIS in theories and methods that are unique to each, but may cross over well. For example, cognition theories that HCI borrows from cognitive science may help LIS researchers understand how technological systems are shaping the perception and decision making of library patrons. Conversely, HCI seems to lack the critical perspectives that LIS brings to address social inequities and would benefit from reflective practices in identifying how design processes, theories, contexts, etc are continuing to enable inequalities and bias.\nFinally, what are your favourite parts about QSS Lab?\nThe people! Perhaps its our curiosity, our shared ability to geek about anything, or how satisfying it is to hear about other’s successes. Its such a wonderfully supportive community. Second, I really like the breadth of our research topics. There’s technical work, (which can be really deep and satisfying), and there’s critical work of deconstructing, (which can be personally rewarding), and topics that genuinely interest me as well as those that are surprisingly interesting! ( I think anything can be interesting if you ask the right questions.)\nCompared with prior professional experience, our QSS group and SIM as a whole are quite unique. There is a real chemistry at work that support collaboration, thoughtfulness, critical thinking, and communal goodwill. So, its quite unique and special in my opinion. I plan on being here for quite some time, thank you very much."

    "text": "In October 2022, several members of the QSS Lab presented at Metrics 2022: ASIS&T Virtual Workshop on Informetrics and Scientometrics Research sponsored by Elsevier’s International Center for the Study of Research (ICSR). Both Poppy Riddle and Geoff Krause were awarded Best Student Paper. Congratulations to Poppy and Geoff for their outstanding presentations and research!\nGeoff Krause presented the study “Who re-uses data? A bibliometric analysis of data citations and the relationship between authors and data creators” (Krause, G., Bowman, T., Rosati, D., Mongeon, P., & Smit, M.) It is widely recognized that open science has widespread benefits not only for science and society, but also for individual researchers (McKiernan et al., 2016). A study by Drachen et al. (2016) suggested that papers get more citations when the underlying data is made available. But when data is re-used, are the datasets themselves being cited, and if so, by whom? Past studies that investigated citations to datasets found that formal data citations are generally rare (Peters et al., 2016; Robinson-García et al., 2016), and observed field differences in data citation practices (Peters et al., 2016). There have also been attempts to link data creators to researchers in order to capture data sharing practices and incorporate them into the reward system of science (Mongeon et al., 2017). A previous study by Dudek, Mongeon and Bergmans (2019) analyzed citations to datasets from the IFREMER and found that most of those citations came from researchers affiliated with the organization, and that 75% of the citing papers had at least one author in common with the dataset. This project increases on the scale of their work by analyzing citations to 474,609 datasets, and the relationship between the citing authors and the creators of the 30,582 datasets with at least one citation. This is, to their knowledge, the first analysis to provide large-scale empirical insights on data re-use with a focus on data self-citations.\nPoppy Riddle presented her work “The use of institutional repositories for green Open Access in Canadian universities” (Riddle, P., Simard, M-A., Gone, P., Li, V., & Mongeon, P.) This study investigates the use of institutional repositories (IR) for self-archiving journal articles in the U15 universities as well as the presence of institutional policies and publisher embargos. While 45.1% to 56.6% of publications are available in open access (OA), only 0.5% to 10.7% are found in the IRs. We found only three university-wide OA policies, and embargo periods of 12 months or more for 25.6% of journal policies. This suggests that IRs play a minor role in OA practices, and a need for more policies related to self-archiving and the use of IRs specifically.\nSee the official announcement on the ASIS&T website, here."

    "text": "Research activities are a large part of the work of university librarians. However, their work often suffers from a lack of visibility, resulting in untapped potential for exchange and collaboration between librarians and researchers in information science. This project aims to help break down the silos in which the two primary target audiences- information science researchers and academic librarians- conduct their research. Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science makes visible the work that librarians do and allows other Canadian researchers to discover the research of their colleagues. We hope that this will stimulate increased collaboration amongst university librarians and researchers across Canada.\nThis project consists of a database and an open citation index, listing the research contributions of Canadian librarians and researchers in information sciences. This dataset and its source code is made available through this GitHub repository. It contains two CSV files; one of LIS authors, and their publications. These datasets are also available on Zenodo here. For those interesting in contributing, you may do so through the GitHub repository.\nAlso available is an interactive platform which allows users to view and export publications. In the future, it will also allow users to contribute to the completeness and quality of the data by proposing additions or modifications. This tool will promote and explore research in information science in Canada and help break down the walls that separate librarians and researchers by making them aware of the results of their respective research. This database will be updated annually with new publications.\nThis project is part of a larger SSHRC funded project of workshops and conferences and provides a means to explore a database of publications from the information science community in Canada. The website LIS Canada, available here will also provide access to these tools.\nThis project was carried out by two teams from Dalhousie University (QSS Lab) and the University of Montreal, in partnership with the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL), the Maritime Institute on Science, Technology and Society (MISTS) and the School of Library and Information Science (EBSI) of the University of Montreal. The project is directly linked to CARL’s mission to improve the contribution of librarians to research and higher education, to foster the efficiency and sustainability of the creation, dissemination and preservation of knowledge, and to promote access to research results. It is also linked to the activities of the MISTS, which offers support for research on science and its relations with society, in particular by providing researchers with a technological infrastructure designed for bibliometric research."

    "text": "QSS Lab is looking forward to welcoming Rémi Toupin back to Halifax this spring. Remi is starting two years at Dalhousie as a FRQSC postdoctoral fellow. Here we profile Remi, learn about his recently completed thesis, and find out what projects he will be working on at the lab!\nRémi, tell us about your doctoral thesis! What interested you in the subject and inspired you to dive deeper into this project?\nFor my thesis, I worked on the contexts of climate change research circulation on Twitter. Specifically, I aimed to better understand how altmetrics and traces left by scholarly documents on Twitter could be used to examine the public attention to scientific articles about climate change. I looked at this by focusing on who tweeted scientific articles, their interactions in terms of retweets and mentions, as well as their resonance to said articles, that is the way users eventually relate to scientific articles through their experience of the world.\nI initially began my PhD because I wanted to do something that involved research about scientific communication and why it is so relevant. During my master’s degree in anthropology, I began to be involved in various initiatives to get a broader public interested in archaeological research… and why it was relevant to do archaeological research. This happened about at the same time as the 2012 Quebec student protests during I which I started to get more socially and politically involved, especially regarding environmental issues. I felt, and still believe, that reducing our footprint on nature is critical to leave the world a better place.\nSo, my thesis was initially on the use of social medias to communicate the scientific aspects of environmental issues… which is quite a big topic! Gradually, I started to increasingly focus on Twitter, mostly because it was heralded as a key environment for the communication of scholarly articles and the development of altmetrics. I also got more critical of social media and metrics in general and wanted to do something that focused on the more qualitative aspects of the public communication of research, specifically how does it relate to those that are involved in it.\nWhat are the different research projects you are working on and what are you most looking forward to working on over the course of your postdoc?\nI have a few projects already going on with QSSLab for my postdoc. As for the fellowship I obtain from the Fonds de recherche du Québec, I’ll work on the gap between scholarly and public attention to marine conservation research. The general goal is to measure which topics in marine conservation research get the most visibility across various indicators like citations, tweets, policy mentions and the news, and better understand why some topics get more or less public attention, specifically in relation to their importance in the scientific literature. We already did kind of a pilot project about the scholarly-public attention gap in shark research, but I’ll look to expand it to other topics.\nI am also looking forward to work on various projects that involve scientific information and environmental issues. One such project involves helping with the bibliometric assessment of GESAMP (Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Protection) reports. I’ll also look to expand some of the work done during my thesis and how we can think differently about the societal impact of research.\nWhat are you most looking forward to working in the QSS Lab and/or living in Halifax?\nTo meet the team! I had a lot of fun the last I came to Halifax and I’m looking forward to just be a part of the team at the QSSLab. Also, the fact that marine conservation and environmental information have are key research topics at Dal means I picked a great environment for my project. I hope to get involve in some science communication initiatives if I can.\nOtherwise, my plan is to enjoy the city and its surroundings as best I can with the people at the QSSLab! Whether it’s exploring various coastal environments on the South Shore or Cape Breton – something I oddly didn’t really experience much before last year, although I have been fascinated by the ocean since my childhood – or enjoying the local culture and city life, I want to make the most of my life in Halifax for the next two years."

Specifically, they seek to identify scholarly outputs and map the research areas and scientific actors associated with topics and issues in ocean science, and measure attention to research areas from scholarly and non-scholarly audiences and stakeholders. We will assess how attention to research about the oceans is distributed across scholarly communities, policy, news media, and social media. Discrepancies of attention to research areas in relation to social and topical dynamics will be exposed, such as whether certain topics are discussed more because they are deemed more attractive by the media, leveraged by policymakers towards certain ends, or due to imbalance of attention resources in research clusters. This will propel tactical responses to knowledge and capacity-building gaps and key areas of oceans research, the mobilization of resources and knowledge production where it is most needed, and lay the groundwork for more effectively bridging the science-policy-public interface.\nThe OFI Seed Fund provides financial support and expertise for ocean-related projects that demonstrate a high potential to grow into larger externally funded research projects or to deliver their impact through commercialization.\nLearn more about other Dalhousie projects funded by the OFI Seed Fund.\nStay up to date on QSSLab projects here."

However, our intent is not to compare the two rankings and explain the differences in their outcome, but to compare metadata records for the subset of publications that are indexed in both OpenAlex and WoS, with a focus on describing discrepancies and measuring their frequency. We do not consider WoS as a gold standard against which OpenAlex records can be tested for their quality. Instead, we consider each database as a benchmark for the other.Our research questions are as follows:\n\nRQ1: How frequent are discrepancies between WoS and OpenAlex records in terms of document type, language, publication year, and number of authors?\nRQ2: What share of records with discrepancies are correct in WoS, OpenAlex, neither, or both?\nRQ3: What explains these discrepancies?\n\nThe choice of the metadata elements selected for the study (document type, language, publication year, and number of authors) was guided by their use as factors for inclusion in the CWTS Leiden Ranking: articles and reviews (document type) in English (language) published in a three-year period (publication year). The same metadata are also relevant in the production of normalized indicators for bibliometric research more generally. Indeed, normalized indicators would typically aim to compare publications of the same type, published in the same year. Additionally, the number of authors tends to be the denominator when counting publications using the fractional counting method (also provided in the Leiden Ranking). Therefore, discrepancies in these metadata elements of publication records are more likely to have a direct effect on the outcome of bibliometric analysis.\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the metadata quality of the subset of publications indexed in both OpenAlex and WoS. Our findings may offer useful insights to those using or planning to use OpenAlex, and may also point to possible paths to correct matadata errors, which could be helpful for database providers. Our intent is not to establish best practices or to formulate recommendations for database creators or users, nor to determine which database is better than the other. Our study is solely motivated by the desire to contribute to a better understanding of our data sources."

    "text": "Identification of discrepancies\nFor each matching WoS and OpenAlex record, we compared the following four metadata elements: 1) document type, 2) language, 3) publication year, and 4) number of authors.\nFor the document type, we did not consider discrepancies where a record is a review according to WoS and an article according to OpenAlex, and vice versa (i.e., we consider articles and reviews as the same document type). Furthermore, OpenAlex indexes conference papers as articles, and the source type (conference) is meant to distinguish them from journal articles. For these reasons, we only considered discrepancies for which the record is identified as an article or a review in either WoS or OpenAlex, but is identified as neither in the other source. We also excluded discrepancies for which the record is a meeting abstract in WoS and an article in OpenAlex. Overall, we found 429,692 discrepancies that met these criteria (6.5% of all records in the dataset).\nThe identification of discrepancies in language, publication year, and number of authors was limited to the subset of 5,936,235 articles and reviews with no discrepancy in document type (i.e., the records that are articles or reviews in both WoS and OpenAlex). The publication language is recorded in its long form (e.g., English) in our WoS data and its ISO code (e.g., en) in OpenAlex, so we created a list of all language combinations (e.g., English-EN, English-FR), determined which ones constitute discrepancies, and identified 33,516 discrepancies (0.6% of all articles and reviews) in publication language between WoS and OpenAlex.\nThe publication year and number of authors being numeric indicators, identifying discrepancies in these metadata fields is easily done by calculating the difference between the two values and flagging all non-zero values. We identified a total of 480,884 discrepancies (8.1% of all articles and reviews) in publication years and 71,133 discrepancies (1.2% of all articles and reviews) in the number of authors. We recorded them both as dichotomous variables (discrepancy vs no discrepancy) and as differences between the two values, which allowed us to measure both the frequency and the strength of the discrepancies.\nWe obtain the direction and extent of the discrepancies by substracting the OpenAlex publication year or number of author from the WoS values. A difference of 1 indicates that according to WoS the article was published one year (or has one more author) later than according to OpenAlex. Inversely, a difference of -1 indicates that the articles was published one year ealier (or has one fewer author) according to WoS than according to OpenAlex. We then and grouped cases in the bins (-4 or less, -2 to -3, -1, 1, 2 to 3, 4 or more)."

    "text": "Investigation of discrepancies\nWe randomly sampled a sample of discrepancies for manual investigation. For each type of discrepancies, we calculated the required sample size with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of ±5%. The sample discrepancies were manually investigated by looking at the article on the journal’s website and the full text when necessary and available. We recorded whether the WoS or OpenAlex record was correct and, when possible, explained the discrepancy. For the publication year, it is typical for articles to have two publication dates: the date of the first online publication and the date of the publication of the issue. For cases in which the online publication year was recorded in one database and the issue year was recorded in the other, we did not consider either database to be correct.\nFor author discrepancies, the landing page and, when available, the published version was examined for author counts. Where available, author declarations, acknowledgements, and CRediT declarations were also considered to clarify authorship where groups or consortia were involved in the production of the work. For languages, the full text was the primary source, followed by the publisher’s landing page for recording observations on language assignment. We recorded multiple language full texts if available, as well as translated abstracts available on the landing page. There are limitations to using the publisher landing page with a web browser.  The language encoding in the head of the HTML could be used by the GET request to display your preferred language type, if the server is configured to respond to such a request.\nThis process allowed us to go beyond the simple counting of differences between the databases and gain insight into the different factors that can cause discrepancies and estimate the percentage of erroneous records in each database. One caveat, of course, is that because our process relies on discrepancies in identifying errors, we are not considering cases where both databases contain the same error."

Most documents in both data sources are articles and reviews.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Distribution of records by document type in WoS\n\n\n\nWoS Document TypeRecordsnpctarticle5,434,90682.24review510,3227.72editorial material266,7054.04meeting abstract117,1361.77letter113,8741.72book review67,5711.02correction67,2711.02news item11,9830.18retraction8,2900.13biographical-item6,5160.10Other*3,6690.06total6,608,243100.00*Includes cc meeting heading, poetry, expression of concern, reprint, art exhibit review, item withdrawal, film review, bibliography, fiction, creative prose, theater review, record review, music performance review, software review, music score review, hardware review, tv review, radio review, dance performance review, excerpt, database review, data paper, note, and script.

We find that in both tables the majority of discrepancies indicate a misclassification of a record as an article or review. However, WoS is much more accurate at detecting misclassifications in OpenAlex (93.5% of the sample) than in WoS (68.8% of the sample). This generally points to a much larger number of OpenAlex records misclassified as articles or review compared to WoS.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Discrepancies for documents categorized as articles or reviews in the WoS but not in OpenAlex\n\n\n\nType in OpenAlexDiscrepanciesSampleErrorsnpctnpctnpctletter5,00855.733156.721966.2editorial1,34114.98714.96372.4book-chapter1,30414.58514.685100.0preprint8409.3549.21425.9paratext2402.7142.414100.0erratum1491.781.4675.0other830.940.700.0retraction280.310.21100.0book50.100.000.0total8,998100.0584100.040268.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Discrepancies for documents categorized as articles or reviews in OpenAlex but not in WoS\n\n\n\nType in WoSDiscrepanciesSampleErrorsnpctnpctnpcteditorial material161,62853.235054.330888.0book review67,43522.214622.6146100.0letter30,69910.16510.165100.0correction19,3036.4406.240100.0news item11,3363.7233.623100.0biographical-item5,9412.0111.711100.0retraction3,7271.271.17100.0other3,5131.230.53100.0total303,582100.0645100.060393.5"

Unsurprisingly, the quasi totality of records are in English in both databases. It is important to note, once again, that our results are note meant to reflect the compositon of the entire databases, but only the subset of documents included in both, which expectedly underestimate the representation of non-English literature especially on the OpenAlex side. Also important to reiterate here is that we our WoS data includes only the SCI-E, SSCI, and A&HCI, and not the ESCI which would include more non-English records.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Distribution of records by language in WoS\n\n\n\nLanguage in WoSRecordsnpctEnglish5,895,51599.31German14,4530.24Spanish7,9690.13French6,1720.10Chinese3,9150.07Russian1,9780.03Portuguese1,5260.03Polish8730.01Japanese7730.01Turkish5800.01Other2,4810.04Total5,936,235100.00\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the dominance of English in the dataset, we also observe differences in the languages that compose the top 10 in each database, as well as in their ranking. Spanish, French, and Portugese are much more prevalent in the OpenAlex records than in the WoS. On the other hand, Chinese is the 5th most prevalent language in the WoS data, but does not make the top 10 in OpenAlex. Since these are supposed to be the same set of records, these differences point to significant discrepancies in the language between the two databases.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Distribution of records by language in OpenAlex\n\n\n\nLanguage in OpenAlexRecordsnpctEnglish5,886,86499.17Spanish13,7770.23German13,2440.22French10,4660.18Portugese3,2030.05Polish1,0580.02Turkish9090.02Hungarian8410.01Croatian5910.01Romanian5370.01Other3,6530.06Unknown1,0920.02Total5,936,235100.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Discrepancies\nFor this part of the analysis, we focus on articles and review that are in English in Web of Science or in OpenAlex, and in a language other than English in the other database. In other words, we do not investigate discrepancies between Portuguese and Spanish or French and German, but only discrepancies for which one of the languages is English (e.g., English-German, English-Chinese).\nTable 7 and Table 8 respectively display the number of discrepancies found for articles in English in WoS and articles in English in OpenAlex. They also display the number of records manually investigated to determine whether the discrepancies stem from mislabeling non-English content as English, as well as the result of that investigation. To understand how an incorrect assignment may have occurred, we looked at the abstracts and full text on the landing page as well as the full text when it was available. Most sampled works seem to have multi-language abstracts either on the landing page or in the PDF of the full text. Also, some articles are published in multiple language, meaning that for some of the discrepancies observed, both OpenAelx and WoS are correct.\nA first observation is that WoS appears to be more accurate than OpenALex in terms of publication language. Table Only 20,086 English publications in the WoS were in another language according to OpenAlex, and in slightly less than half (48.2%) of the verified cases, the article was in fact in English.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Language discrepancies for articles and reviews in English in WoS\n\n\n\nLanguage in OpenAlexDiscrepanciesSampleErrorsnpctnpctnpctSpanish7,02934.812838.08264.1French5,58027.610130.03130.7Portugese2,11110.43811.32360.5German1,5987.9267.7830.8Romanian5292.682.400.0Hungarian5202.692.79100.0Turkish4642.361.8583.3Croatian4002.041.200.0Polish2901.430.93100.0Other1,6908.4144.2642.9Total20,211100.0337100.016749.6\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we notice that for some languages, such as French, German, Romanian and Croatian, the discrepancies correctly flagged articles mislabelled as English in WoS, although the sample sizes for Romanian and Croatian were quite small.

We obtain the direction and extent of the discrepancies by substracting the OpenAlex publication year from the WoS publication year. A difference of 1 indicates that according to WoS the article was published one year later than accoridng to OpenAlex. Inversely, a difference of -1 indicates that the articles was published one year ealier accoring to WoS than according to OpenAlex.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Number of publication year discrepancies for articles and reviews in WoS and OpenAlex (total and sampled)\n\n\n\nDifference in publication year (WoS - OpenAlex)DiscrepanciesSamplenpctnpct-2 to -32,5490.5205.1-158,52612.2389.61392,68181.727670.12 to 323,1664.8205.1&lt; -32,0690.4205.1Total480,884100.0394100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation for Publication Year Discrepancies\nFrom our investigation of the discrepancies, we observed four general possible publication year that one record can have in either database:\n\nIssue year: the year of the journal issue in which the article is officially published. This is also the year included in the reference to the article.\nFirst publication year: the year in which the article was first published online before it was assigned to an issue.\nOther year: another year that is recorded in the article’s history but is not a publication year (e.g., submission year, accepted year).\nSource unclear: we use this code when the publication year in the WoS or OpenAlex record does not match any of the years listed in in the landing page or the PDF.\n\nWe used these four scenarios to group publication year discrepancies between WoS and OpenAlex into six categories. The first two are 1) OA has first year, WoS has issue year and 2) OA has issue year, WoS has first year. In these cases, we considered both databases to be correct because both dates are actually referring to a publication event. The following four categories indicate errors in one of the databases that include none of the two accepted publication years: 3) OA has other year, 4) OA source unclear, 5) WoS has other year, and 6) WoS source unclear.\nAs shown in Figure 1, erroneous publication years are rare overall in the sample that we analyzed and mostly occur when there are significant discrepancies between the WoS and OpenAlex publication years. However, these errors appear to be more prevalent in OpenAlex. For half of the sampled articles published 2 or 3 years later according to OpenAlex compared to WoS, the source of the OpenAlex publication year was not found on the article landing page or PDF and appeared to be wrong. This was also the case for 20% of the articles with a publication year in OpenAlex three or more years earlier than in the WoS. In contrast, we only found a few instances (four in total) where the WoS publication year appeared to be erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that discrepancies for which the OpenAlex year is prior to the WoS year are largely explained by cases where OpenAlex has the first publication year and WoS has the issue year, especially when the discrepancy is small (one year). This is expected given that the first publication year is typically before the journal issue year. Inversely, most cases in which the WoS publication year is prior to the OpenAlex publication year are explained by cases where WoS has the first publication year and OpenAlex has the journal issue year. Interestingly, neither database appears to be systematic in the way it indexes the year of first publication or the year of the journal issue."

For these cases, many of the discrepancies are explained by what appears to be a different treatment of group authors by OpenAlex and WoS. As shown in Table 13, OpenAlex appears to be counting as authors each member of the group listed on the byline, but only when that list is displayed on the landing page. However, the group tends to be ignored when its members are not listed on the landing page. WoS usually does not count members of a group listed on the byline as authors, regardless of whether or not the names appear on the landing page.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13: Treatment of group authors in WoS and OpenAlex relative to the presence of the group members list on the landing page.\n\n\n\nGroup authors on landing pageOpenAlexWoSCountedIgnoredCountedIgnoredNo465168Yes3710839\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile group members are typically not counted as authors in WoS, the group itself typically is. For example, a paper with two authors and a group with 10 members will have an author count of 3 in WoS. Conversely, OpenAlex does not include the group in the author count, so the same paper will typically have an author count of 2 or 12, depending on whether the group members appeared on the landing page.\nFor papers with a group author, OpenAlex and WoS having a different author count for the same paper does not mean that either database contains the correct number of authors. However, for publications that do not have group authors, determining which database has the correct author count is more straightforward. As shown in Table 14, OpenAlex was more likely to be correct (74.8% of the time) in these cases.\n\n\n\n\nTable 14: Number and share of valid records in OpenAlex and WoS in cases of author count discrepancies with no group authors listed on the byline.\n\n\n\nbinSampleOpenAlexWoSnpctnpctnpct&lt; -364.7583.3116.7-2 to -386.3787.5112.5-14434.63988.6511.412620.52388.5311.52 to 32721.31970.4829.6&gt; 31612.6212.51487.5Total127100.09574.83225.2"
